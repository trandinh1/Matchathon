# My AthenaHacks Project

## Description

Hi
This project was created for the AthenaHacks hackathon. While we all came in with unique and innovative project ideas, we struggled to form teams that complemented our skills, interests, and availability. There wasn’t an efficient way to find teammates who shared our vision while also bringing in diverse strengths. This frustration inspired us to create Matchathon—a web app designed specifically for hackathon team building. We wanted to build a platform that not only helps users find teammates based on skills and interests but also streamlines communication and hackathon management.

## Features

- Feature 1: Create a profile showcasing their skills, interests, and availability.
- Feature 2: Find and match with teammates using a Tinder-like swiping mechanism based on compatibility.
- Feature 3: Manage teams and stay organized through the My Team dashboard.
- Feature 4: Communicate with teammates via real-time messaging to collaborate effectively.
- Feature 5: Explore upcoming hackathons and register directly within the platform. Our goal is to help hackers form strong, compatible teams so they can focus on what really matters—building impactful projects and learning from the experience.

## How We Built It 
We built Matchathon as a full-stack web app using: 
- Frontend: React.js & Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.
- Backend: Node.js & Express.js to handle authentication and team matching.
- Database: MongoDB to store user profiles, hackathon events, and matches.
- LLM: Google Gemini for making matches based on similar interests and compatible skills
